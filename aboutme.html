<h1>Bahubali</h1>
<p3>Bahubali, a much revered figure among Jains, was the son of Rishabhanatha (the first tirthankara of Jainism) and
    the brother of Bharata Chakravartin. He is said to have meditated motionless for a year in a standing posture (kayotsarga) and 
    that during this time, climbing plants grew around his legs. </p3>
