<h1>Ballaladeva</h1>
<p3> Bhallaladeva is the son of Bijjaladeva and Rajamatha Sivagami Devi.
    He is raised by Sivagami along with his cousin Amarendra Baahubali.
    He is a great warrior and is as equally skilled as his cousin.
    However, he is not empathetic towards his subjects like Amarendra and has a ruthless personality.
    He is often misguided by his father Bijjaladeva to take evil steps. He ruled over Mahishmati for 25 years. </p3>
